Time had lost all meaning for me recent days.

There was no beginning and no end, and the days and nights flowed into one another in a seamless rhythm. The working stuff had become my whole life...and the outside world was a foreign, faraway planet.

Each week came and went, and a new month began. In the world outside, the novel coronavirus was raging on, and there was no word from my brother and other friends in the United State, hopefully they'll all right and back to home soon.

The early saturday morning telephone calls had stopped as suddenly as they had started. I was relieved that no new mysterious and troublesome, or even threatening incidents of company system had befallen me. It was almost as if they had all been a bad dream...except, of course, they hadn't been.

Network-protect campaign namely 'Hu Wang' operation is also about to kick off...officially, after all intractable elaboration have had been prepared amid each weekend day and daily life.

The routine continued to be frantic, there was no time to keep in touch with someone flipped me.  The office of Technical Development  Department was a jungle filled with chaos, and each project team or group had its own peculiar sounds as they were chatting and negotiating. There were buzzers, open meetings, voices of orders, and the constant chatter on the RTX, and they all blended into a loud, insane cacophony.   

If I had kept the diary, I would have marked all theses days as temper will under conditions that preclude dissenting opinions.  I am happy that I'm still the boy who was constantly running errands for everyone in my thirties, I can still through the crowd like a cheerful tornado with brightest smile and the sunnest disposition.

Just keep working, keep dancing...and, take more sleep if possible ðŸ˜‚
